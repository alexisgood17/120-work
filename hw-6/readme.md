  ## 1. Work Done This Homework Cycle
  This week, I created an algorithmic sketch. I decided to incorporate randomly generated colors and positions into my program. I also attempted to use more unfamiliar functions, like map() and constrain(). In the end, I created a sketch that outputs random lines in different colors depending on the y-axis of the mouse, resulting in an ombre or watercolor look.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  First, I tried to play around with different ideas. I settled on creating something randomly generated that also incorporated algorithms. I started with generating lines that had a maximum and minimum amount of variation, like a "walker" program. After that, I started to incorporate things like map() and constrain() in order to refine the program.
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
 As always, there was a lot of trial and error involved in this assignment. I had to play around with the different values in order to understand each new function.
