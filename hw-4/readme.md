  ## 1. Work Done This Homework Cycle
  This week, I had to create a self portrait using p5. I was able to look at a couple of examples in order to figure out the best way to create my image. I ended up making a (sort of) self portrait.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  First, I had to come up with an idea for what I wanted to create. Then, I figured out how to break down the picture into individual shapes. I separated each component into its own block of code and broke down those parts even further to completely finish my portrait.
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
  There was a lot of trial and error involved in creating my portrait. It was difficult to visualize the grid in my head, so I ended up changing the coordinates for shapes many times. It was time consuming work to tweak every little part of the image and then check back with the index.html file every time I needed to change something. In the end, I am fairly satisfied with the way my portrait turned out.
