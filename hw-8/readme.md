  ## 1. Work Done This Homework Cycle
  For this assignment, I used nested for loops to create a pattern of randomly sized and colored squares. I had to refresh myself on for and while loops while also learning more about them.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  I looked to examples in the lesson for inspiration. I took one of the examples for for loops and tried to play around with the values and properties to make it my own. I also attempted to make the squares repeat in rows (before noticing that was already done on the example after). I incorporated random dimensions to the squares and made them fill the entire screen.
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
  Though this assignment was a little easier than others, the hardest part was thinking of what to create. The properties of for and while loops kept me interested in this project, however,
