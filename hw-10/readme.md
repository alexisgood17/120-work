  ## 1. Work Done This Homework Cycle
  For this assignment, I had to create a program that included functions and arrays. I decided to use empty arrays to generate randomly positioned shapes. Along with this, I made separate functions to generate either an ellipse or rectangle.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  First, I created empty arrays. In the setup function, I filled them by creating random numbers to push into the arrays. I then created two separate functions for both the rectangle and ellipse array. In those functions, I set random colors to generate as well as a for loop that loops through every indexed value to create shapes. Lastly, I called those functions in the draw() function.
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
  It was difficult to understand how arrays can be represented visually in this way, but I had no problems creating new functions. I had to test each function a few times in order to make sure I understood what was going on.
