## Final Proposal

- For my final project, I want to create an audio visualizer that incorporates many of the elements learned in class.
- Audio visualizers are fairly prevalent and common programs, but I wanted to attempt it myself in order to understand how they work. I was inspired by well known visualizers like Kauna and MilkDrop that create complex and interesting visualizations.
- I know it will be difficult to create an interesting or original visualization. I plan on using Javascript and the Audio class to run this program, so I may need to work to familiarize myself with that part of javascript.
- I have done some research on how to execute this kind of program with the Audio class. I plan on finalizing the individual functions to play the music and process the audio first, and then focus on the visual effects I want to produce. I think most of my work will be focused on the visual aspect, so I'll have to devote most of my time to that part.
