  ## 1. Work Done This Homework Cycle
  This week, I had to create an animation with a few different requirements. It had to take into account the width and height of the canvas, have an animation based on the movement of the mouse, and have another animation that happened with changing variables.
  ## 2. Steps Taken
  First, I went through a few different ideas in order to figure out what I wanted to submit. I decided I wanted to try creating a set of coordinates that updated with the mouse position. Additionally, I needed to create another independent animation. I decided to play with color and change the background color based on a variable used for greyscale values.
 ## 3. Issues and Questions
  At first, I had issues with the coordinates not 'going away' after each new iteration of the draw function. I had to troubleshoot for a while until I realized that I needed to update the background color inside of the draw function. This basically 'colors' over the last bit of text, ensuring that there is no illegible trail of numbers. It also lead to the inspiration for changing the background color each time. Though I'm already pretty familiar with javascript, learning the different aspects of p5 has been a challenge.
