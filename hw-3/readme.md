# Homework 3 Response 

#### Work Done this Cycle
This homework cycle, I learned about using p5 and javascript to make code with visual results. I took several steps to complete this assignment:

- I made a "hello world" program using javascript and p5 to display it on a web browser as well as a few other pieces of code using different p5 features, including `setup()`, `createCanvas()`, `background()`, `draw()`, and `text()`.
- I also created a static web page with GitHub to host my p5 programs. Using that page, I hosted my "hello world" script to make it accessible on a web broswer.

#### Issues and Questions
I am already somewhat familiar with javascript, so refreshing my memory on different functions and syntax within the language was easy for me. P5 is new to me, however, so learning about that was a new experience. I did not run in to many issues, though I imagine I would have if I didn't already have knowledge about javascript. Again, this assignment was turned in late, so I did not use the issue tracker or help any classmates out with this assignment. Hopefully as I catch up I will be able to interact with these features more.
